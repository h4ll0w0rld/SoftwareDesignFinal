Software Design Abgabe: 


Welcome to my Project :) 

There are two ways to get it running: 

1. Go to my Git and clone repository (Link in "Abgabeinfo");
2. extract the zip and drag folder into VSC. --> "yes i am a trusted author ;) "


Start things of: 
1. start node Server 
        -navigate to Server Folder and run: node NodeServer.js
2. open index.html in your Browser (either via Liveserver or just drag and drop);

If you need Admin rights:
     username= admin password = admin
